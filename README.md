# iOS Calculator Mockup App

![Calculator App Screenshot](src/images/screenshot.png)

A fully functional React calculator built to handle basic arithmetic operations, percentages, and sign toggling. Created with the help of Gemini and ChatGPT.

This calculator supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with floating point numbers. It includes percentage calculations, sign toggling (+/-), a clear (AC) button, and keyboard support. It also handles multiple operators and prevents invalid input sequences.

To install, clone the repository and install dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/arminayaz/ios-calculator-mockup.git
cd react-calculator
npm install
npm start
```

### Usage:

Click the buttons or use your keyboard to input numbers and operations. Press "=" or "Enter" to calculate results. Press "AC" or "Escape" to clear the input. Toggle sign with "+/âˆ’". Calculate percentages with "%".

### Testing:

Run unit tests with:

```
npm test
```

Unit tests cover basic arithmetic operations, decimal handling, sign toggling, percentage calculations, clearing input, and keyboard interactions.
